## Problem 0.1 and 0.2

This repo is for P8105 Homework 1.

## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
p_variable = names(penguins)
```

There are 8 variables in penguins dataset.

Names of the variables are species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

``` r
p_row = nrow(penguins)
p_col = ncol(penguins)
```

This is the size of the penguin data set.

There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

``` r
p_flipper = na.omit(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
mean_p_flipper = mean(p_flipper)
```

The mean flipper length of this penguin dataset is 200.9152047 mm.
