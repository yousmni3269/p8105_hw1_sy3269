## Problem 0.1 and 0.2

This repo is for P8105 Homework 1.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

I loaded necessary packages (e.g. `tidyverse`).

## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
p_variable = names(penguins)
p_row = nrow(penguins)
p_col = ncol(penguins)

p_species = count(penguins, species)
```

There are 8 variables in penguins dataset and the names are species,
island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g,
sex, year.

There are 3 species in the dataset and the names are Adelie, Chinstrap,
Gentoo.

There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

``` r
p_clean = na.omit(penguins)
mean_p_flipper = mean(p_clean[["flipper_length_mm"]])
```

Missing data were removed first to make a clean penguins dataset. Then
the mean flipper length of the clean dataset was found to be 200.966967
mm.

``` r
ggplot(p_clean, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = (species))) + 
  geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("penguin scatterplot.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

This is a scatterplot of the clean penguins dataset where x =
bill_length_mm and y = flipper_length_mm. The different species are
noted in different colors.

## Problem 2

``` r
my_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10), 
    vec_log =  norm_samp > 0, 
    vec_char = c("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "eggplant", "fig", "grape", "honey", "iceberg", "jujube"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A"))
  )
```

I created a data frame comprised of a *random sample* of size 10 from a
standard Normal distribution, a *logical vector* indicating indicating
whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a *character vector*
of length 10, and a *factor vector* of length 10, with 3 different
factor “levels”.

``` r
my_df_vec_log = pull(my_df, vec_log)
my_df_vec_char = pull(my_df, vec_char)
my_df_vec_factor = pull(my_df, vec_factor)

mean(my_df_vec_log)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(my_df_vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(my_df_vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(my_df_vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(my_df_vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Attempt to take the mean of each variable in my data frame was made. For
logical vector, mean was calculated because **TRUE** and **FALSE**
correspond to **1** and **0**. However, for character vector and factor
vector, the mean could not be calculated because they were not *numeric*
or *logical*.

``` r
my_df_vec_log_num = as.numeric(my_df_vec_log)
my_df_vec_char_num = as.numeric(my_df_vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
my_df_vec_factor_num = as.numeric(my_df_vec_factor)
```

Attempt to convert the variables to *numeric* type was made. The logical
and factor variables were converted to *numeric* but the character
vector could not be converted. ?
